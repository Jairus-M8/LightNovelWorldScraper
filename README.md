## Installation

To install and run this project, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Node.js** installed. You can check if Node.js is installed by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
```

If it's not installed, download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Jairus-M8/light-novel-world-scraper.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd light-novel-world-scraper
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    Run the following command to install all the necessary npm packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Setup**:
    - The scraper requires images for the EPUB cover. Ensure you have a folder named `img/` in your project directory and place a cover image (e.g., `Shadowslave.jpg`) in it. The scraper will prompt you to select an image during the process.

## Usage

To run the scraper, use the following command:

```bash
node scraper.js
```

The program will prompt you for the following information:

1. **Series URL**:
    - Paste a valid **Light Novel World** URL for any chapter in the series. The program will automatically extract the **series slug** from the URL to scrape multiple chapters.

    **Valid URL Examples:**
    - `https://www.lightnovelworld.co/novel/{series-name}-{series-id}/chapter-{chapter-id}`
    - `https://www.lightnovelworld.co/novel/the-beginning-after-the-end-548/chapter-6-16091352`
    - `https://www.lightnovelworld.co/novel/lord-of-the-mysteries-275/chapter-1103`

2. **Volume Information**:
    - Series title
    - Author
    - The volume number (e.g., Volume 1, Volume 2).

3. **Chapter Range**:
    - The start and end chapter numbers for the volume.

4. **Cover Image**:
    - Select a cover image for the volume. You can either use the same cover image for all volumes or choose a different image for each volume.

5. **EPUB Generation**:
    - After scraping the chapters, the program will automatically generate an EPUB file for the specified volume range.

The generated EPUB files will be saved in a folder named based on the series name, for example, `Series_Name_Here_EPUB/`.

### Example Flow:
1. Enter the **series URL** (the scraper will extract the **series slug**).
2. Enter the **series name** and **author name**.
3. Choose the **starting and ending volume numbers**.
4. For each volume:
   - Enter the **custom title** and **chapter range**.
   - Choose the **cover image** for that volume (or use the same cover for all volumes).
5. The scraper will fetch the chapters and create an EPUB for each volume.
6. The output will be saved in a folder named after the series, such as `Series_Name_Here_EPUB/`.

## Folder Structure

- `img/`: Folder containing the cover image(s) for the EPUB.
- `scraper.js`: Main script for scraping and generating the EPUB file.
- `Series_Name_Here_EPUB/`: Folder where the generated EPUB files will be saved (named based on the series).

### Example of Folder Structure:

```
/light-novel-world-scraper
  /img
    - Shadowslave.jpg (cover image for EPUB)
  /Series_Name_Here_EPUB
    - series_name_volume_1.epub
    - series_name_volume_2.epub
  scraper.js
  package.json
  README.md
